### Opendrive Track generator (OOP version)
_This rewrite would not have been possible without __Daniel's__ and __Ronald's__ prior work on the main branch._

Rewritten with Classes in the hope that it will make the program less convoluted, easier to maintain and expand.

The logic behind how it generates the tracks is the same as the main branch. It shares the same issues as well.
